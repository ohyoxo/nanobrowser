## 🤖 Choosing Your Models

Nanobrowser allows you to configure different LLM models for each agent to balance performance and cost. Here are recommended configurations:

### Better Performance
- **Planner & Validator**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet
  - Better reasoning and planning capabilities
  - More reliable task validation
- **Navigator**: Claude 3.5 Haiku
  - Efficient for web navigation tasks
  - Good balance of performance and cost

### Cost-Effective Configuration
- **Planner & Validator**: Claude Haiku or GPT-4o
  - Reasonable performance at lower cost
  - May require more iterations for complex tasks
- **Navigator**: Gemini 2.0 Flash or GPT-4o-mini
  - Lightweight and cost-efficient
  - Suitable for basic navigation tasks

### Local Models
- **Setup Options**:
  - Use Ollama or other custom OpenAI-compatible providers to run models locally
  - Zero API costs and complete privacy with no data leaving your machine

- **Recommended Models**:
  - **Qwen 2.5 Coder 14B**
  - **Mistral Small 24B**
  - We welcome community experience sharing with other local models in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NN3ABHggMK)

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Local models require more specific and cleaner prompts
  - Avoid high-level, ambiguous commands
  - Break complex tasks into clear, detailed steps
  - Provide explicit context and constraints

> **Note**: The cost-effective configuration may produce less stable outputs and require more iterations for complex tasks.

> **Tip**: Feel free to experiment with your own model configurations! Found a great combination? Share it with the community in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NN3ABHggMK) to help others optimize their setup.
